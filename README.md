Coursera - University of Michigan - Applied Data Science with Python - assignments
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python

These assignments were submitted for the 5 courses in the University of Michigan's Applied Data Science with Python specialization offered on Coursera. I enjoyed the specialization which offered a broad applied intro to the field. Due to the focus on "applied", there are gaps in theory as well as practice but overall seems to be a solid start to my data science learning journey.

The courses in the specialization are:
1. Introduction to Data Science with Python
2. Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python
3. Applied Machine Learning in Python
4. Applied Text Mining in Python
5. Applied Social Network Analysis in Python

Please note, my code may not be the most Pythonic nor may yield the best results with Coursera's autograder.
This repository does not contain the underlying data files that are needed to run the Python notebooks but can be obtained via each course's Jupyter notebooks.

There are so many data science learning resources online. I am interested in courses that are Python based and on-demand.  
Pressing on, I plan to take Jose Portilla's 2021 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass:

Further courses/textbooks I am interested in:

Machine Learning by Andrew Ng
- https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
Python Data Science Handbook - free textbook recommended by most
- https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/
An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R (ISLR) - free textbook recommended by most
- https://www.statlearning.com/
- https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python (converted ISLR's R code to Python)
Statistical Learning @ EdX - 1 course. The course uses R but I may just go through the textbook which is free and there are a few people who have converted the R code to Python and posted their jupyter notebooks on Github.

Deep Learning Specialization @ Coursera - 3 courses
- https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning

If you need to learn or brush up on Python:

Foundations of Python Programming - I completed this online textbook through Coursera's University of Michigan's Python 3 Programming Specialization Certificate and it was quite beneficial. You don't need to go through Coursera to use the textbook for free but will miss out on the Coursera certificate if that's ok with you. It provides an interactive coding environment though it will not save your work if you do not register. If you are a school instructor, you can register for free I believe and then your students can sign up so it will save all work done in their browser based environment.

Now I know Python, what about Statistics?

OpenIntro Statistics - used at UC Irvine for undergraduate and graduate stats courses as well as numerous community colleges and top tier universities.
If you click on the "Labs" tab, you can see exercises using R as well as Python.

Now I know Python and Statistics, what about Data Science?

For a quick look into Data Science for free without an option for a certificate:
Learn Data Science Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners (Cool intro, Barton Paulson loves R but most nowadays recommend to learn Python instead)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua-CiDNNj30
Matthew Brett's Data Science course borrows heavily from a UC Berkeley DS course but uses pandas and matplotlib instead of the custom libraries UC Berkeley uses to teach the course (which aren't used outside in the "real world")

Here are 3 youtubers that have some cool perspectives:
